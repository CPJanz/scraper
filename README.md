# scraper

Star City Scraper is a site that scrapes the free articles off of Star City Games. Created as an exercise in creating full stack sites, it uses Express, MongoDB, Express-Handlebars and Cheerios.

## Known Issues

The root route is not currently working correctly but adding anything else to it will cause the page to act correctly (Try: https://mtg-scraper.herokuapp.com/a).
